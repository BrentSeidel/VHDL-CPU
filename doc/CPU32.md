# CPU Documentation

A block diagram of the current state of the CPU is below.  As should be
obvious, it is far from finished.

This will probably never be a particularly high performance or sophisticated
CPU.  I will declare victory once I get a basic set of instructions to
work properly.

The Vidor 4000 also has a 8 MB SDRAM chip that will require a memory
controller to access.  This would be outside of the CPU, but would be
needed for it to really be useful.
